  <p>Resident doctors in Nigeria's public hospitals have threatened to go on strike indefinitely<br> if the government
    fails to meet their demands about wages.<br> The threat comes from the National Association of Resident Doctors of
    Nigeria (NARD),<br> the 5000 strong trade union that represents doctors<br> below the rank of consultant practising
    in public hospitals in Nigeria.
  <div>To press home their point, the doctors embarked on what they called a "warning strike"<br> between Monday and
    Tuesday this week.<br> Commenting on the need to embark on the warning strike,<br> the association's president,
    Jerry Oguzie said,<br> "We have watched helplessly as our profession has been terribly bastardised,<br> and
    infrastructural decay has overtaken our hospitals and health clinics.</div>
